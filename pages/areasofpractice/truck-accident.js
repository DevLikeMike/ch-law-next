          <h2>Truck Accidents</h2>
          <p>
            Trucks are around us every day of our lives, some people say they
            are the back bone of America. We call them many things, 18-wheelers,
            semi-trucks, big rigs, and tractor trailers. If you have driven on
            the interstate, chances are you have passed one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average size of a commercial truck, or semi, is around 75,000
            pounds. In comparison, your typical four door sedan is around 3,500
            pounds. This means the semi truck can make a normal car look tiny
            beside it. Due to this large size difference, accidents involving
            such a large truck can be life changing.

          <h2>Causes of Truck Accidents</h2>
          <p>
            Truckers are considered the driving force behind America. Due to the
            large demand for them and their services, truck accidents are common
            You because they are always on the road. Many factors can be at play
            when determining cause in truck accidents. Examples may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Distracted driving</li>
            <li>Speeding</li>
            <li>Failure to obey traffic laws</li>
            <li>Tailgating</li>
            <li>Driving under the influence</li>
            <li>Road rage or aggressive driving</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Determining Who Is Liable</h2>
          <p>
            In most car or truck accidents it is likely the driver of one
            vehicle is liable for the accident. If the driver of the truck
            suffered from one of the above, it is likely the driver's negligence
            will hold them responsible for the truck accident.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in truck accidents, the truck driver's employer can be at
            fault. If it can be found that the driver's employer made the driver
            work too many hours, or the driver was not properly trained, or the
            truck was overlaoded, or a poorly preformed background check put a
            dangerous driver in the truck, then the employer can hold
            responsibility for the truck accident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, if the negligence of the employer contributed to the
            truck accident, the employer is responsible for the truck accident.
            This may be true for the truck's manufacturer also.
          </p>
          <h2>Handling Your Case</h2>
          <p>
            Handling such a complicated case can be hard, especially on your
            own. Large truck companies hire the most experienced and aggressive
            lawyers to ensure they pay you as less as possible. That's why when
            you hire Casey Hall Attorney at Law, we make sure to use our most
            experienced and aggressive lawyers to counter. We make sure the deck
            is not stacked against you, and you get the compensation you
            deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            When handling a truck accident case, there are a few key topics to
            help us get you what you deserve:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Preparation: </b>When filing a claim with an insurance company,
              you need to fully understand how much you are entitled to, and
              what you are likely to be given. Calculating the cost of future
              medical bills, lost wages, and suffering can be nearly impossible.
              Allowing our experienced legal team to help you answer these
              questions will ensure that we are fighting right by you and your
              needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Evidence: </b>Everything you claim in court will need to be
              provided with PROOF. How do you prove future medical treatment
              costs? Our attorneys and ready to contact experts to get testimony
              for your future needs, as well as proof they are a direct result
              of your accident.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Negotiation: </b>Many insurances companies have been around for
              decades. And over that time, they have gotten very good at getting
              people to accept less money then they deserve. They are likely to
              say that the offer they give you is the best they can do. However,
              with our experienced legal team, we will make sure that you are
              given the settlement you deserve, and not just a lowball, "better
              than nothing", offer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Your Case In a Court: </b>More times then not, truck accident
              cases settle outside of court. But, if you are given an
              insufficient settlement offer, you may take your case to court. If
              you are alone, this can be daunting and overwhelming. But, with a
              team of experienced lawyers by your side insurance companies are
              more likely to give you a fair settlement. And, if they do not, we
              are more than willing to stand in the court room and fight for
              your settlement.
