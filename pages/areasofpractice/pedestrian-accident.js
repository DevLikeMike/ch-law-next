            Kentucky, known for its serene landscapes and bustling cities,
            unfortunately also attracts a significant number of pedestrian
            accidents. These incidents occur when a pedestrian, whether walking,
            jogging, or simply crossing the street, is struck by a motor
            vehicle, often resulting in severe injuries or even fatalities. The
            repercussions of a pedestrian accident inflict both physical and
            emotional trauma on victims and their families, highlighting the
            importance of understanding the legal recourse available to them.
